This repository contains the project developed in the course Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis,
held by Prof. Alberto Garfagnini during the a.y. 2019/2020. The idea and the setting of the work are
taken from the paper "Inferring vaccine efficacies and their uncertainty" by G. D'Agostini, A. Esposito (2020).
